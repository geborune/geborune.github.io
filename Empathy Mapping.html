    <h1>Empathy Mapping</h1>
 
 <h2>Uncovering your interverviewee</h2>

<h4>
Empathy maps are important because they give designers an avenue into the mind of the customer and help them empathize with their experience, desires, and needs.  <br>
They’re also useful for taking insights you gain from user research, digging deeper, and applying them to find concrete solutions. 
How do you use persona empathy mapping?</h4>


<h4>
To create an empathy map, start with a direct statement, from user interviews or direct feedback.  <br>
From there, you create a constellation of thoughts, feelings, and actions that underly the customer’s statement and help you understand why they made the statement  <br>
and what their underlying motivations are.
</h4>

    <h2>Empathy Maps</h2>

    <p>A typical empathy map includes four quadrants:</p>
    <p>
 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>Say – What the user says about the question asked. Ideally, this section contains real quotes from users recorded during interviews or user testing sessions.</li>
  <li>Think – What is the interviewee is thinking? What occupies the user’s thoughts? What matters to the user?</li>
  <li>Feel – This section contains information about the interviewee’s emotional state. What worries the person being interviewed? What does the user get excited about? <br>
    How does the interviewee feel about the experience?</li>
   <li>  Do – What actions does the user take? What actions and behaviors did you notice?</li>
 
</ul>
